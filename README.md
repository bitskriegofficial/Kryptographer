# Kryptographer
A Python swiss army knife for cracking classical cryptography.

## The Aim
Combine all existing ciphers and implementing scripts to crack each of them. Eventually, this project aims to evolve further by accommodating advanced features such as brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks.

In the end you should be able to use it like this:

```
from Kryptographer import CaesarDecrypter
DecrytedInput=CaesarDecrypter('Input')
```

### Prerequisites
None! We do not assume ANY background knowledge. Knowing about basic cryptography and python can make your life easier.

### Who is this for?
Anyone who:
* Wants to explore the field of Cryptography.
* Wants something awesome to put in their resume.
* Needs an excuse for making their time productive.
* Is bored sitting at home, watching TV Series and movies.
* Wants to serve the Soviet Union.(just kidding xD)

## The Plan
1. For the first 2 weeks, we will give you content on Cryptography to consume. If you are not familiar with Python, we will give resources for that too.
2. After these 2 weeks, we will select people to contribute to the project and start with it. 
* Note that this is just to weed out people who join and don't work. If you've put in effort, you are in.
In exceptional circumstances, we may allow people to join late.
