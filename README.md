# Kryptographer
A Python swiss army knife for cracking classical cryptography.

## The Aim
We take all existing ciphers and implement scripts to crack each of them. Eventually, this project aims to evolve further by accommodating advanced features such as brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks.

In the end you should be able to use it like this:

```python
from Kryptographer import CaesarDecrypter
decrytedInput=CaesarDecrypter('Input')
```

### Work we will do 
We will decrypt all the classical ciphers(Caesar Ciphers, Substitution Ciphers, etc.), using the internet as our guide. We shall then improve the scripts to make it work on least information as input. This can be achieved by a brute-force.

We will then work on techniques to smartly brute-force other ciphers than cannot otherwise be broken.

We will combine all decrypting scripts and break ciphers without giving the cipher as an input, by basically bruteforcing the encrypted text.

## Prerequisites
None! We do not assume ANY background knowledge. Knowing about basic cryptography and python can make your life easier.

### Who is this for?
Anyone who:
* Wants to explore the field of Cryptography.
* Wants something awesome to put in their resume.
* Needs an excuse for making their time productive.
* Is bored sitting at home, watching TV Series and movies.
* Wants to serve the Soviet Union.(just kidding xD)

## The Plan
### For Cryptography Explorers
* We will give you content on Cryptography to consume. If you are not familiar with Python, we will give resources for that too. They must be completed within 2 weeks.
* In these 2 weeks, we will select people to contribute to the project and start with it. Note that this is just to weed out people who join and don't work. If you've put in effort, you are in.

### For Cryptography Pros
* We start working right away after an assignment. If you don't shine in the assignment, we shall put you with the Cryptography Explorers.

In exceptional circumstances, we may allow people to join late.
